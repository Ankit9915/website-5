Lake Punica National Park is an excellent choice for short, or even long trips from the nearby town of Lavito. Being a protected national treasure since the early 1940's, it is an ideal place for relaxation. For people seeking adventures, the Sanarit Crater is just a short distance away and will surely pose a welcome challenge.
