It has been the lifelong dream of many to be able to build harbours in TTDLX. Now you can! Well, not real harbours but designs that resemble harbours which is just as good :).
On this very busy screen we see some Brush 'AL 10' trains hauling wood (at the bottom); at the top Bursh 'Type 4'transporting livestock. A luxury oceanliner is waiting for passangers and a futuristic JTech J-1 Roku from the excellent AV8 set is leaving the screen at high speed on the right.
