This picture focuses on some of the new GUI elements of 0.5.0. For the first time we see the in-game NewGRF gui allowing graphical GRF selection, a huge step towards user friendliness. A new colour scheme window, supporting 2CC's (Two Company Colours) is also present; effects can be seen on the Fokker F.VII in the aircraft list. From the vehicle lists (or the depot for some actions) you can now mass-manage your fleet. Mass start/stop, sell, send to depot, etc. all just a click away. Pretty nifty.
