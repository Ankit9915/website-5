OpenTTD has its own window management as it runs on so many platforms. This picture has been stuffed to unplayability with windows. We can see company income, finances and performance rating (which is used as a score when you finish the game). We can also see two construction-toolbars, with the tree-tool selected. On the left side is the list of trains, which will be sorted by total capacity.
A bit to the right we can see a relief-map, which can be toggled to show various states (relief, transport routes, ownership) and allows you to scroll around the 'universe'. On the right side we have zoomed into a Concorde making a hefty profit judging by the details window. Lastly an almost invisble detailed industry window.
