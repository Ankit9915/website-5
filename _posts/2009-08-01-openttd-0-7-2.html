We have done it again. What? Well, we have released another bugfix release of the 0.7 series. This release changes how vehicle payments happen, so now you will get paid when the vehicle is unloaded instead of when it starts unloading. This fixes lots of 'exploits' that allowed people to get more payment than they should have gotten.
