title: Title game 1.0 series

We have had many requests to update the introduction/title game of OpenTTD as it was 'too old'. As the title game is used for savegame compatability tests we did not want to do that, but as stable branches do not get much (if any) savegame changes we decided that for each stable branch we would get a different title game. The 1.0 series stable branch will be the first that will have a new title savegame.<br/><br/>The voting is now over and you can see the results on <a href="http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=46598">the forum</a>.
