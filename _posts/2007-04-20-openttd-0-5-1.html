After long waiting we present OpenTTD 0.5.1. It's basically OpenTTD 0.5.0 with a fairly long list of all kinds of bugfixes, ranging from a desync to some Unicode fixes. For more information you can look at the <a href="http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?t=31586">topic on the forum</a>.

Have fun with this new release!
