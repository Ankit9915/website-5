Less than 24 hours after the start of our fundraiser, we are happy to tell you that we reached, and exceeded, our goal. We raised a total of <b>Â£310.12</b> within 20 hours. We thank you very much for your support, it is great to know we have such a supportive community behind us, and it motivates us even more to continue what we do: improve a great game to become even more great.<br/>

Although we have enough to support our current hosting needs, we would love to buy our own dedicated server, so we can run the nightly builds on our own system. Currently it is kindly donated by one of our users, but we already know this won't be for ever. By buying our own dedicated server, we ensure ourselves of nightly builds now and in the future. Therefore we do ask you to continue to donate to support us. Not much more is needed to reach that goal. But as we don't see it are primary goal, we won't put it into a fundraiser. Even so, we thank you very much for anything you can do for us.<br/>
<br/>
As this was our first fundraiser ever for OpenTTD, we had no idea what to expect. But we are truly surprised by your support. Such a large amount in such a short time. We are truly grateful, and hope you will keep enjoying OpenTTD as we do.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all once again!
