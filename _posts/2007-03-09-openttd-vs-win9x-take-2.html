title: OpenTTD vs Win9x - Take #2
author: Darkvater

You might remember that back in December we talked about Windows 95/98 and Windows ME and why their support for the nightlies has been discontinued.<br/>
The good news is that the problem has been solved, provided that you download the <b>win9x</b> binary. All users of more recent Windows OS's (2000, XP and Vista) should get <b>win32</b> to enjoy full UNICODE support.<br/>
What is the bad news you say? None :)
