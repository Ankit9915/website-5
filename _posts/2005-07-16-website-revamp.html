As you can see the OpenTTD website has enjoyed a major rewrite. It is now featuring the same design as <a href="http://servers.openttd.org">servers.openttd.org</a> and helps us administer it better.<br>
Credits go to <a href="http://www.hesslow.se/" target="_blank">Hesslow</a> for the new design, I'll take credit for the coding. We hope you like it!

On another note, Ludde, the original author of OpenTTD has returned from the darkness and is already busy adding nice features. Three cheers for him!
