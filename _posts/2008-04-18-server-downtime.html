title: Server downtime

Dear Users,
<p/>
Due to a migration of the OpenTTD services to another physical server there will be some downtime. The downtime is expected to occur between 19:00 and 22:00 UTC on Saturday April 19th.
<p/>
This also means that the master server, the server that tells you which servers are online, will not be available for a while.
<p/>
We thank you for your understanding and we hope you can survive for a little while without those services.
