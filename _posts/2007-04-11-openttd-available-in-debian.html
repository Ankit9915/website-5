title: OpenTTD available in Debian

<p>As of yesterday, openttd packages are available from the <a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian</a> archives. While debian packages have been available for download from Sourceforge since 0.3.5, Debian unstable users can now simply use apt to install and upgrade openttd.</p>

<p>The package should also be available for users of Debian testing shortly. Unfortunately, we have missed the release of the current Debian stable (etch), but we will try to include openttd in the <a href="http://www.backports.org">backports.org</a> archives soon for users of Debian stable.</p>

<p>Thanks go out to Jordi Mallach for helping me with packaging and uploading the package to Debian. See also this <a href="http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?p=573677#573677">forum topic</a>.</p>
