The next Release Candidate (#4 now) is released within two weeks of the previous version. A highly recommended update.<p/>

Release highlights of this RC are various desync fixes for a much more stable MP experience, Japanese, Slovenian translations, OS/2 support and the ability to load games without the exactly matching NewGRF files.
