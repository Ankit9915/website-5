As of today, the NoAI Framework is merged in trunk. After months of hard work, we finally realised it.<br/>
<br/>
NoAI is an API (a framework) to build your own AIs in. See:<br/>
<a href="https://wiki.openttd.org/AI">https://wiki.openttd.org/AI</a><br/><br/>
With many thanks to:<br/>
<br/>
<ul>
  <li>glx and Rubidium for their syncing, feedback and hard work</li>
  <li>Yexo for his feedback, patches, and AIs which tested the system very deep</li>
  <li>Morloth for his feedback and patches</li>
  <li>TJIP for hosting a challenge which kept NoAI on track</li>
  <li>All AI authors for testing our AI API, and all other people who helped in one way or another</li>
</ul>
<br/>
As of tonights nightly, the NoAI framework will be included, together with a simple AI. For more (and better AIs), please visit the forums:<br/><a href="http://www.tt-forums.net/viewforum.php?f=65">http://www.tt-forums.net/viewforum.php?f=65</a>
