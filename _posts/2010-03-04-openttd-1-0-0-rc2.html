Today we have released our second release candidate for 1.0.0. We are working on removing all bugs in OpenTTD so we get an as stable as possible 1.0.0 release. Can you help finding and fixing these bugs? More information about this release can be found <a href="http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=47480">on the forum</a>.
