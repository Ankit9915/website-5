title: New Days Have Come

Today our new servers arrived to host all the main internet services for OpenTTD. Also today, we moved everything to the new servers.<br>
<br>
The coming of the new servers mean that we will start to collect all the internet services, which are now hosted all over the world by a lot of different people, to one place. When we are done with that, we set up mirror-servers in different countries, which will duplicate everything the main servers have, so we can serve you this page even faster ;)<br>
Currently, the servers are located in The Netherlands. Known mirror-servers will be in Hungary and possibly Germany. Currently we are NOT looking for other mirror-servers, when we do, we will announce that here.<br>
<br>
For this I really want to thank Orudge for making it happen. Thank you!<br>
<br>
Some things all developers/coders need to about due to recent changes:
<ul style="list-style: none;">
<li>- us.svn.openttd.org is gone. Orudge and I merged us.svn and nl.svn to one server: nl.svn.<li>- the MasterServer (in-game server-list), will be moved to this new server soon. Expect some in-game troubles with the gamelist around that time (DNS update)
</ul>
If you notice any problems that you think is related to the change of servers, please report it via the BugTracker on <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=103924&amp;amp;atid=636365">SourceForge</a>.
