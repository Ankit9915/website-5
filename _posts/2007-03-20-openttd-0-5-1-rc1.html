Less than a month after the final release of 0.5.0 the list of bug in 0.5.0 was so big that we have started the release cycle for the 0.5.1 bugfix release.<p/>

In this release you can find a few new small features like an extra news group for opening and closing industries so you can disable all those industry production changes and still get notified when industries are created or shut down.<br/>
The most noticable fix for people who like to play with the AI is that AI processor consumption has been greatly reduced, although at the price of some intelligence. Furthermore some crashes and a desync have been fixed.<p/>

As the installation of the Microsft Unicode layer for Windows 95, Windows 98 and Windows ME proved to be difficult for people (yes, reading is difficult), there is now a special win9x build for those platforms. Users of Windows 2000, XP, 2003 and Vista should continue to use the win32 binary.<p/>

Take a look at the <a href="http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?t=31077">forum post</a> for more information about this release.
