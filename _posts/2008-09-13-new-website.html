<p>Behold! A new web design. With this new design, and many many other things that happened behind the screen, we hope to enter a new Era for the web-related services of OpenTTD. Over the last few weeks we did a lot of work to increase the quality of the services. For example, we moved to a new dedicated server located at <a href="http://www.leaseweb.com">Leaseweb</a>, EvoSwitch, Haarlem, The Netherlands. But also, we merged all the services which were scattered over the web to a single place. And today, we welcome a new website, and a new compile-farm.</p>

<p>With a big thanks to 'kohrar' for the web-design, and a big hug to Osai for his hard work on most images, Rubidium and I managed to create a XHTML 1.0 strict website, which looks <i>exactly</i> the same on almost all browsers. Needless to say we are very proud of that result.</p>

<p>In the next few weeks we will be adding new services to the webpage, and integrate others. The main goal is to make a website which can be maintained by the active developers themselves. This should greatly improve the quality of all those services.</p>

<p>One of the other things you might notice, is that the website is available in all languages which OpenTTD support in-game. For now, not all languages will have a translation ready, but we hope to get the complete webpage translated in all languages, so you can enjoy OpenTTD also on the web in your native language.</p>

<p>Other new features of the new website are an improved download section, and soon support for mirroring. Together with this comes a new compile-farm, which produces much more robust binaries. For example, MSVC is used to compile Windows binaries. This avoids a lot of problems we had in the past. Sadly enough, not all targets are ported to this new system yet, and for example the OSX users will need to wait a bit longer before they can enjoy this new system.</p>

<p>Many more new features are planned, but that is all in the future. For now I hope you enjoy the new design. Any problems you find/notice can be reported via the forum. Also suggestions are of course very welcome. Enjoy the new OpenTTD website!</p>
