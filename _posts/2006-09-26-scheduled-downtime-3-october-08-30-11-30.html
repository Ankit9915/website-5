[Update] - All hardware is moved, and all services should be operational again.<br>
<br>
3 October 2006, around 08:30 UTC, all webservices of OpenTTD will be down for 2 to 3 hours, because of hardware movement.<br>
<br>
The servers, where most of the services are currently located (RedBus, Amsterdam, The Netherlands), have to be moved to a new location (Eweka DataCenter, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Because it involes hardware movement, all servers and other related hardware (network, ...) will be shut down, moved to the new location, to be put back online there. We expect it will take around 2 hours to do the movement, and possible an other one for problem solving.<br>
<br>
Services involved are: www, dev-space, master-server (also the in-game server-list), mail(list), SVN and torrents.<br>
Services that will be ineffected: bugs, wiki, nightly and translator.<br>
Around 11:30 UTC it should all be up and running again. We will let you know when it does.<br>
<br>
If you have any questions, feel free to drop a mail to {mailto:truelight@openttd.org}.
