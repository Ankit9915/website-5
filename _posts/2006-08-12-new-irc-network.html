title: New IRC Network

Today we moved to a new IRC Network: OFTC. For a long time we were having minor and some bigger problems with FreeNode. Today we decided that this has been enough (for all kinds of reasons) and followed #debian in their action.<br/>
<br/>
If you want more information about why we moved, feel free to contact either Bjarni or TrueLight. They can explain the reason in great detail.<br/>
<br/>
You can now find us at: irc.oftc.net, in #openttd. We hope you all move with us.<br/>
