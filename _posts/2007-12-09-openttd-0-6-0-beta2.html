Tonight we have released the second beta of the 0.6(.0) series containing a few small features and a fair amount of bugs have been fixed.
<br><br>
Let's hope that this beta has way less bugs than the first beta so we can release 0.6.0 'soon', but then releasing 0.5.0 took 3 months so nothing is certain.
