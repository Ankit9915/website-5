title: Server downtime

OpenTTD's web services (this website, source repositories and the masterserver) and the forums will be down for around 3 hours, perhaps a bit more, on the evening on the 16th of July (this Wednesday), due to us moving datacentre. The downtime is scheduled to occur at about 18:00 UTC, although it may occur slightly before then, and may last longer than 3 hours. Due to DNS changes, you may have trouble accessing the site for up to 24 hours after that, if your ISP caches the DNS records for too long.
