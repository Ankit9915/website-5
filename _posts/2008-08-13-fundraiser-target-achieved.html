I'm happy to announce that our fundraiser is now closed - in just under 22 hours, our fundraiser has resulted in a grand total of <b>£494.30</b> worth of donations (we were aiming for £486.00), with a few bank donations still to come through. Thank you to everybody for your donations, which will go towards keeping OpenTTD's services running in the year to come on a brand new server!
