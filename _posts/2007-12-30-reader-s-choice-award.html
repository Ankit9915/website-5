<p>We are happy to announce our second received award in a hopefully long list to come. OpenTTD has won first prize of the HUP community (HUP = Hungarian Unix Portal) reader's choice contest in category 'Favourite Free Game'. You can read the official announcement <A href="http://hup.hu/node/48704" alt="official announcement in hungarian">here</a> (Hungarian).</p>
<p>This is the second time OpenTTD has been awarded with first prize by the HUP community, last time in 2005.</p>
<p>The accompanying logo will be put up shortly in its own honourable space as soon as I figure out where to put it exactly ;). Until then...</p>
