Today we have released 0.5.2, the second bugfix release of the 0.5 series. We suggest that all users of 0.5.1 and 0.5.0 upgrade to this version as it fixes a bug that could crash all clients and the server in a network game.

This being a bugfix release means that no new features have been added, nevertheless you can have lots of fun with this release.
