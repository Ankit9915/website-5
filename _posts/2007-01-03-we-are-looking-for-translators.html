... for the following languages:
<ul>
<li>Afrikaans</li>
<li>Croatian</li>
<li>Frisian</li>
<li>Galician</li>
<li>Icelandic</li>
<li><font style="text-decoration: line-through;">Japanese</font> [MADE IT]</li>
<li>Latvian</li>
<li><font style="text-decoration: line-through;">Nynorsk (New Norwegian)</font> [MADE IT]</li>
<li><font style="text-decoration: line-through;">Simplified chinese</font> [MADE IT]</li>
<li><font style="text-decoration: line-through;">Traditional chinese</font> [MADE IT]</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is the deal: If any language listed above will miss at most 100 strings at the end of this week (including weekend), I'll include that in the final and long awaited 0.5.0 release.</p>
<p>Let's go people, I know a lot of you would like to play a localised version of OpenTTD!</p>
<p>You can always check the translation statistics <a href="https://translator.openttd.org/">here.</a></p>

<b>Update!</b><br>
Due to the big success of this campaign, and since the release of 0.5.0-RC3 delayed the final 0.5.0, I prolong this action until end of this week (14th of January, 2007) or until the final 0.5.0 gets released (whichever comes sooner)! Don't miss it out!
