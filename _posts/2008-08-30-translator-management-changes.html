title: Translator management changes
author: Rubidium

As of today the management of the translators has changed. The most visible change is the change in email address. The new email address for all questions regarding user accounts of the web translantor tool (WT2) is: {mailto:translator@openttd.org}. With these changes we hope to add more continuity to the management of the translators.<br />
We kindly ask people who sent an email to the old address over the last few months and didn't receive a reply to send it to the new account so we can handle them.
