title: OpenTTD 0.5.0 Release Candidate 2
author: Darkvater
---

The next release candidate is out, with quite a few bugs found (they never run out, do they?) and fixed. Go ahead, give it a try.<p/>

The same things as for RC1 apply for RC2, namely Win9x, unicode, etc. Translators have been great, except for Icelandic and Galician which seem to be inactive. If someone wants to volunteer...<p/>

Downloads are just a click away (click on lighthouse), Forum post is <a href="http://tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?p=535834#535834" target="_blank">here</a> and bugs go to <a href="http://bugs.openttd.org/" target="_blank">Flyspray</a>.<p/>

Happy New Year from the whole development team!
