After a long (but not long enough) development phase, I opened WebTranslator2 as a beta service. This means that everyone who feels enough courage to translate OpenTTD to her/his native language are welcomed to ask for a translator account. See details at <A href="http://translator2.openttd.org/" target="_blank">WebTranslator2 home page</A>.<BR>
Happy translating!
