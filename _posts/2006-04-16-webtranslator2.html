After a long (but not long enough) development phase, I opened WebTranslator2 as a beta service. This means that everyone who feels enough courage to translate OpenTTD to her/his native language are welcomed to ask for a translator account. See details at WebTranslator2 home page [dead link].<BR>
Happy translating!

<a href="https://translator.openttd.org/">WebTranslator2 was since replaced by Web Translator</a>
