For some weeks now we removed MorphOS from the nightly compiles, because there was a big problem with the compiler we used for MorphOS. But today we resolved those problems (with a big thanks to tokai, Rubidium and TrueLight), and so the MorphOS nightlies are back! This means that MorphOS is again official supported and that there will be a MorphOS version of 0.6 (till today, this was not certain yet).<br/>
<br/>
So to our MorphOS users: enjoy the game!
