title: Removal of nightly targets
author: Rubidium

From tomorrow onward the nightlies targets macosx-intel, macosx-powerpc and all macosx dedicated builds will be removed from the compile farm. 
<br/><br/>
One can replace each of these targets with the macosx target as this is a binary that works on both PowerPC and Intel (x86) processors. Furthermore a dedicated build is not needed anymore because this can also be done with the universal binary.
