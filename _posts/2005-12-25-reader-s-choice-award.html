We are happy to announce our first received award in a hopefully long list to come. OpenTTD has won first prize of the HUP community (HUP = Hungarian Unix Portal) reader's choice contest in
category 'Favourite Free Game'. You can read the official announcement <a href="http://www.hup.hu/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=10324&amp;mode=nested&amp;order=0&amp;thold=0" target="_blank">here</a> (Hungarian).<br>
The accompanying logo will be put up shortly in its own honourable space as soon as I figure out where to put it exactly ;). Until then...<p>
